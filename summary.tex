\section{Introduction}
Observing subjects perform acts of choice is the basis of much work in econometrics.
Most of these approaches consider only acts of choice that are performed spontaneously, such as when studying willingness to pay or when studying reactions of individuals to varying frames as in the celebrated work of Kahneman and Tversky \citep{bell_descriptive_1988, kahneman_thinking_2012}.

On the other hand, since at least the seminal work of \citet{fishkin_when_2011}, another sort of judgment involving subjective desirability is emerging as also worth studying. These are judgments given by subjects after arguments in favor and against different possible stance have been considered. Such judgments may differ from immediate judgments of desirability given in natural conditions. Indeed, individuals may change opinion on the desirability of some course of action, and therefore revise their choice, while learning about the properties of objects, the consequences of some acts (or empirical knowledge useful to estimate the likelihood of some consequences), or the logical or empirical impossibilities between consequences. This is particularly likely to happen when choosing among non everyday objects or acts whose consequences are not well known by the subject.

While numerous articles have discussed the concept of deliberation in the last decades, it remains unsettled, to the best of my knowledge, how to observe a deliberated judgment in a systematic and reproducible fashion. There is a need to define this concept sufficiently precisely that, first, it is clear what counts as a deliberated judgment (i.e., when “sufficient” \citep{meinard_justification_2020} or “correct” deliberation has happened); and second, it is clear which part of the claim is empirical and which part stems from an unfalsifiable conception of what “deliberated” means. 

For conceptual clarity, I focus on judgments that take the form of a choice indicating a preference between two options. 
This article is therefore interested in defining the concept of \emph{deliberated choice} of a subject and show how one can study it in an empirical manner. 
One goal of this endeavor is to ensure that disagreements about someone’s deliberated choice in a given context can in principle be solved by an empirical experiment, provided the very conception of what constitutes a deliberated choice is shared. 

While the concept of deliberation in the deliberative democracy literature usually refers to multiple individuals debating, this article considers deliberation as related to a single individual: an individual deliberates (in the sense of: carefully weights) the stance she considers most appropriate while being confronted to arguments. In this sense, deliberated choices come close to what \citet{rawls_theory_1999} calls reflective equilibrium (referring to an idea of \citet{goodman_fact_1983}), a concept that has much inspired the present proposal.

The “classical” counterpart of deliberated choices, that does not involve confrontation with arguments, will henceforth be called the shallow choices.

To define deliberated choices, one needs to start with the set of arguments under consideration, and the way the subject gets to know them, called hereafter the “exposure protocol”. 
As a result, we need always talk about the deliberated choice \emph{given some exposure protocol}. 
This accounts for the fact that because the very way that the arguments are transmitted to an individual may affect her choice differently \citep{railton_facts_2003}. 
The notion of argument invoked here is an extremely large one, including texts, images, sounds, experiences (a hiking trip), and so on: anything that can be transmitted to a subject qualifies as a possible argument. In particular, such an “argument” need not have the logical structure of what is considered a proper argument in argumentation theory. This important feature of this proposal permits to avoid taking a position on what is a correct argument, and permits to study wide enough conceptions of deliberated choice, including those involving no paternalism \citep{cailloux_formal_2020}: anything that influences the choice of a subject, as judged by the subject herself and not by any external standard, may a priori be considered worth including in at least some conceptions of deliberated choice, thus including whatever some could consider as “incorrect reasoning” or “bad reasons”.

This approach yields a conceptual and practical clarification. It proposes a sharp distinction between the empirical content and the normative content of the concept of deliberated choices: the definition proposed here transfers the full normative weight on the choice of the exposure protocol; and leaves the rest of the disagreements to empirical settling. 
In supplement to a possibly helpful conceptual clarification, such a sharp separation may reveal practically useful for separation of concern as it permits to study deliberated choices empirically under various exposure protocols independently of possible disagreements about which norms are more appropriate for deliberation in which circumstances.

The exposure protocol defines a set of argument and, importantly, how arguments are sent to the subject and her subsequent choice observed. There is no explicit dependency on the internal process that occurs in the subject’s mind while she (possibly) processes the arguments, as it is not desirable to assume that the internal process could be observed. We consider subjects as black boxes and only require a capacity of observation of their choices after exposure to arguments.

The deliberated choice of a subject is defined as a function of the exposure protocol: someone’s deliberated choice equals the set of choices that resist every counter-arguments. The notion of resistance is itself defined according to the exposure protocol.

Studying choices resulting from exposure to arguments includes a difficulty that is not present with shallow choice experiments: exposing an individual to arguments may change the individual’s stance, an effect that cannot be erased in order to submit the individual to an unrelated sequence of arguments. The observer thus cannot in general assume that multiple unrelated sequences of arguments can be tested on a given individual. This difficulty will be worked around by considering general theories of deliberated choices, that apply to sets of individuals. 

I will introduce properties of theories of deliberated choice, discuss how to falsify such theories, and present results about the settings in which it is guaranteed that suitable theories exist.
